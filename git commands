#Switch pecan to your fork

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your username>/pecan.git

# Setup pecan to be able to fetch from the master

git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

# Create a branch to do your work.
# A good practice is to call the branch in the form of GH- followed by the title of the issue.
# This makes it easier to find out the issue you are trying to solve and helps us to understand 
# what is done in the branch. Calling a branch my-work is confusing. 
# Names of branch can not have a space, and should be replaced with a hyphen.

# Push your changes up to GitHub.
# If this is the first time pushing to GitHub you will need to extended command, other wise you can simply do a git push.
